It\\u2019s a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do. Most typically, they\\u2019re organised in order of priority. Traditionally, they\\u2019re written on a piece of paper or post it notes and act as a memory aid. As technology has evolved we have been able to create a todo lists with excel spreadsheets, word documents, email lists, todo list apps, Microsoft to do and google to do list to name a few. You can use a to do list in your home and personal life, or in the workplace. Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldn\\u2019t forget anything important. By prioritising the tasks in the list you plan the order in which you\\u2019re going to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you can leave until a little later. The Benefits of Using a To Do List One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised. When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When you\\u2019ve got a clear outline of the tasks you\\u2019ve got to do and those you\\u2019ve completed, it helps you stay focused. While freeing up space in your mind for other more creative tasks. When you complete a task, you can cross it off your list. This gives you a sense of progress and achievement, something you\\u2019ll lack if you\\u2019re always rushing from one task to the next. If you feel a sense of achievement, it spurs you on and motivates you to keep moving forward. But that\\u2019s not the only benefit of a to do list. Here are a few more: Improves your memory: A to do list acts as an external memory aid. It\\u2019s only possible to hold a few pieces of information at one time. Keep a to do list and you\\u2019ll be able to keep track of everything, rather than just a few of the tasks you need to do. Your to do list will also reinforce the information, which makes it less likely you\\u2019re going to forget something. Increases productivity: A to do list allows you to prioritize the tasks that are more important. This means you don\\u2019t waste time on tasks that don\\u2019t require your immediate attention. Your list will help you stay focused on the tasks that are the most important. Helps with motivation: To do lists are a great motivational tool because you can use them to clarify your goals. You can divide your long-term goal into smaller, more achievable short-term goals and as you tick each one off your list, your confidence will increase.\"]\n  }, void 0, true, {\n    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n    lineNumber: 5,\n    columnNumber: 9\n  }, this);\n};\n_c = About;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"About\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["D:/react/To-do-listo/src/MyComponents/About.js"],"names":["React","About"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;;AAEA,OAAO,MAAMC,KAAK,GAAG,MAAM;AACvB,sBACI;AAAA,qDACa;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,YADb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,UADJ;AAsBH,CAvBM;KAAMA,K","sourcesContent":["import React from 'react'\r\n\r\nexport const About = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\nWhat is a ToDo List? <hr /> The definition is a simple one.
